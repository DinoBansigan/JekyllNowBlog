Hey there, my name is **Dino Bansigan**. 

I am a .NET Software Developer currently working for a financial company in the DFW area. I enjoy working with C# and SQL Server. I love  writing code that talks to the database and vice versa. While we do use Entity Framework at work, I found that I like working/writing with stored procedures more. I guess I am just weird that way.

### More Information

When I'm not writing code, I spend most of my time with my family. I love going on roadtrips and doing bike rides with my wife and our energetic toddler. I enjoy playing board games and video games with my wife. 

*I especially enjoy playing solo and coop games. I am actually planning on creating a blog specifically for solo and coop tabletop games. I'll add a link to that on here when it's ready.*
