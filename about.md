Hey there, my name is **Dino Bansigan**. 

I am a .NET Software Developer currently working for a financial company in the DFW area. I enjoy working with C# and SQL Server. I love  writing code that talks to the database and vice versa. I'm just as happy writing SQL scripts, as I am writing code in C#.

I have this mindset that I will forever be a student of software development. There is always something new for me to learn, some new way for me to improve my craft. I look at writing code as an art form. I think solving problems by writing clean, beautiful code is very much like painting a masterpiece. I won't always end up with a masterpiece, but I like to take pride in my code. I think every developer should take pride in their code.

### More Information

When I'm not writing code, I spend most of my time with my family. I love going on roadtrips and doing bike rides with my wife and our energetic toddler. I enjoy playing board games and video games with my wife. I love reading books and listening to rock music.
