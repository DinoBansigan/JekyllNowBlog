Hey there, my name is **Dino Bansigan**. 

I am a .NET Software Developer currently working for a financial company in the DFW area. I enjoy working with C# and SQL Server. I love  writing code that talks to the database and vice versa. While we do use Entity Framework at work, I found that I prefer working with stored procedures more than using EF to talk to the database. I'm just as happy writing SQL scripts, as I am writing code in C#.

I have this mindset that I will forever be a student of software development. I am always eager to learn about new technologies, new design patterns, anything that can help me become a better software developer. I have an interest in artificial intelligence. *(I keep telling my wife that if I'll ever go back to school, it will be to learn about artificial intelligence.)*

I look at writing code as an art form. I think solving problems by writing clean, beautiful code is very much like painting a masterpiece. I won't always end up with a masterpiece, but I like to take pride in my code. I think every developer should take pride in their code.

### More Information

When I'm not writing code, I spend most of my time with my family. I love going on roadtrips and doing bike rides with my wife and our energetic toddler. I enjoy playing board games and video games with my wife. 

*I especially enjoy playing solo and coop games. I am actually planning on creating a blog specifically for solo and coop tabletop games. I'll add a link to that on here when it's ready.*
